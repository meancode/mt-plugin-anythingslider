h2. Usage & Options (defaults)

<pre>$('.anythingSlider').anythingSlider({
	easing: "swing",                // Anything other than "linear" or "swing" requires the easing plugin
	autoPlay: true,                 // This turns off the entire FUNCTIONALITY, not just if it starts running or not
	startStopped: false,            // If autoPlay is on, this can force it to start stopped
	delay: 3000,                    // How long between slide transitions in AutoPlay mode
	animationTime: 600,             // How long the slide transition takes
	hashTags: true,                 // Should links change the hashtag in the URL?
	buildNavigation: true,          // If true, builds and list of anchor links to link to each slide
	pauseOnHover: true,             // If true, and autoPlay is enabled, the show will pause on hover
	startText: "Start",             // Start text
	stopText: "Stop",               // Stop text
	stopAtEnd: false,               // If true, and autoPlay is on autoPlay will stop on the last page
	navigationFormatter: null       // Advanced Use: details below
	forwardText: "&raquo;",         // Link text used to move the slider forward
	backText: "&laquo;",            // Link text used to move the slider back
	width: null,                    // Override the default CSS width
	height: null,                   // Override the default CSS height
	buildArrows: true               // If true, builds the forwards and backwards buttons
});</pre>
	
Linking directly to slides

<pre>$("#slide-jump").click(function(){
	$('.anythingSlider').anythingSlider(6);
});</pre>

To use the navigationFormatter function, you must have a function that accepts two parameters, and returns a string of HTML text.
	
* <code>index</code> = integer index (1 based);
* <code>panel</code> = jQuery wrapped LI item this tab references
* Function must return a string of HTML/Text

Here is a sample formatter:

<pre>navigationFormatter: function(index, panel){
	return index + " Panel"; 		// This would have each tab with the text 'X Panel' where X = index
}</pre>

h2. Changelog

h3. Version 1.3.5

* Added resizePanel option - does not support percentage sizing.
** When true, it will resize all panels & solitary content to the size settings (CSS or the script options).
** When false, the AnythingSlider wrapper will resize to fit the panel (set inline or in the CSS for each panel).
* Fixed keyboard navigation to work with multiple AnythingSliders on a page.
* Added tabbed navigation. Both the links within panels and the thumbnail navigation will activate it.

h3. Version 1.3.4

* Added keyboard navigation.
* Embeded objects will now resize to fit the panel.
* YouTube videos will pause the video when it is not in view and play (if already started) if it is in view.
  Note: this feature only works in non-IE browsers and when the files are hosted on a webserver as the flash player restricts calls between local files and the internet.
* Modified code according to JSLint & added minified version.

* Previous / Next arrows are now optional
* Clicking start button immediately begins transition instead of waiting for the delay

* Dimensions can be passed via javascript or modified at the top of the css file
